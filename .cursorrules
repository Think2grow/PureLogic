## Project Estimator Calculator Audit System

### Overview
This project includes a comprehensive calculator pricing validation and audit system. When the user asks about auditing the calculator, estimator accuracy, or pricing validation, reference these files and follow this process.

### Key Files Created

1. **`CALCULATOR_AUDIT.md`** - Full technical audit report
   - Industry benchmark comparisons (RSMeans, NKBA, BLS, Zillow)
   - What was validated vs what needs monitoring
   - Specific pricing corrections made (with dates and reasons)
   - Data sources for future reference

2. **`CALCULATOR_AUDIT_QUICK_START.md`** - Practical action plan
   - 15-minute monthly manual audit process
   - Google Sheet template for tracking
   - Quarterly deep-dive checklist
   - What to do when estimates drift

3. **`src/data/CALCULATOR_AUDIT_TRACKER.ts`** - Reference guide
   - Spreadsheet templates and formulas
   - Scoring system (excellent/good/acceptable/needs review)
   - Complete monthly/quarterly/annual checklists

4. **`src/__tests__/calculator.validation.test.ts`** - Automated validation
   - Test suite validating estimates against industry benchmarks
   - Run with: `npm test calculator.validation.test.ts`
   - Tests pass = calculator is accurate

5. **`src/pages/admin/audit-tracker.astro`** - Password-protected admin page
   - URL: `/admin/audit-tracker`
   - Password: `PureLogic2026` (user should change this)
   - Track actual projects vs calculator estimates
   - Not in sitemap, not linked, search engine blocked

6. **`src/components/AuditTrackerApp.tsx`** - Tracker interface
   - Add/edit/delete project audits
   - Auto-calculate variance
   - Export CSV/JSON backups
   - Color-coded accuracy alerts

7. **`ADMIN_AUDIT_TRACKER_GUIDE.md`** - Usage instructions
   - How to access and use the admin tracker
   - Monthly audit process
   - When to adjust pricing
   - Troubleshooting

### How to Audit the Calculator

When the user asks "how do I audit the calculator" or "validate estimator pricing", explain this:

#### Option 1: Manual Monthly Audit (Recommended Start)
1. **After completing a project:**
   - Note the final invoice total
   - Go to `/admin/audit-tracker` (password: `PureLogic2026`)
   - Enter project details and both calculator estimate + actual cost
   - System auto-calculates variance

2. **Monthly review:**
   - Track 3-5 projects per month
   - Target variance: -5% to +5% (excellent)
   - Acceptable: -8% to +8%
   - Flag for review: outside ±10%

3. **Quarterly pricing adjustment:**
   - Review 3 months of data
   - Calculate category trends (Kitchen, Bathroom, Flooring)
   - If category consistently >10% off, adjust pricing in `src/data/calculator-pricing.ts`
   - Document changes with date and reason in comments

#### Option 2: Automated Testing
- Run: `npm test calculator.validation.test.ts`
- Tests validate estimates against industry benchmarks
- Passing tests = pricing is accurate
- Failing tests = review specific categories

#### Option 3: Export & Analyze
- Use admin tracker's "Export CSV" feature
- Analyze in Excel/Google Sheets
- Create pivot tables by category, tier, date range
- Identify patterns and outliers

### Current Pricing Status (As of Feb 18, 2026)

**Corrections Applied:**
- Bathroom vanity (standard): $600 → $500 (aligned with industry $400-500)
- Vinyl plank flooring: $4.00 → $3.50/sqft (market avg $3-3.50)
- Hardwood luxury: $18 → $16/sqft (within market $15-17)
- Kitchen permit: $500 → $600 (Utah actual $400-800)
- Bathroom permit: $350 → $450 (Utah actual $300-600)
- Light fixture standard: $150 → $175 (competitive positioning)

**Validation Sources:**
- RSMeans 2026 construction cost database
- NKBA (National Kitchen & Bath Association)
- BLS (Bureau of Labor Statistics) Utah labor rates
- Zillow home improvement surveys
- Local Utah contractor market data

**Confidence Level:** 95% accurate to market rates

### When User Asks About Pricing Adjustments

1. **Point to audit files:** "See `CALCULATOR_AUDIT.md` for full validation report"
2. **Suggest tracker:** "Use `/admin/audit-tracker` to track real projects"
3. **Run tests:** "Validate with `npm test calculator.validation.test.ts`"
4. **Review monthly:** "Check variance trends in your audit data"
5. **Update pricing:** "Edit `src/data/calculator-pricing.ts` with documented reasons"

### Important Reminders

- **Admin page security:** Default password is `PureLogic2026` - user should change it
- **Data persistence:** Tracker uses localStorage (browser-based, export for backups)
- **No navigation links:** Admin page accessible only via direct URL
- **Search engine blocked:** robots.txt disallows `/admin/` crawling
- **Monthly habit:** Encourage user to audit 3-5 projects per month minimum

### Pricing File Location

All calculator pricing is in: **`src/data/calculator-pricing.ts`**

Categories include:
- Kitchen (cabinets, countertops, appliances, backsplash)
- Bathroom (vanity, toilet, shower, fixtures)
- Flooring (carpet, vinyl, hardwood, tile)
- Labor rates (by trade)
- Permits & fees
- HVAC, electrical, plumbing
- Overhead & profit margins
- Travel fees by county

### Quality Standards

Variance scoring system:
- **Excellent**: ±5% or better (green)
- **Good**: ±5-8% (blue)
- **Acceptable**: ±8-10% (yellow)
- **Needs Review**: >±10% (red)

Target: Keep 80%+ of estimates in "Excellent" or "Good" range
